## Uncomment this if you want to force overlay/overlay2 as docker storage driver
## Please note that overlay2 is only supported on newer kernels

## Enable docker_container_storage_setup, it will configure devicemapper driver on Centos7 or RedHat7.

## It must be define a disk path for docker_container_storage_setup_devs.
## Otherwise docker-storage-setup will be executed incorrectly.
# docker_container_storage_setup_devs: /dev/vdb

## Uncomment this if you want to change the Docker Cgroup driver (native.cgroupdriver)
## Valid options are systemd or cgroupfs, default is systemd
# docker_cgroup_driver: systemd

## Uncomment this if you have more than 3 nameservers, then we'll only use the first 3.

## An obvious use case is allowing insecure-registry access to self hosted registries.
## Can be ipaddress and domain_name.
## example define 172.19.16.11 or mirror.registry.io
# docker_insecure_registries:
#   - mirror.registry.io
#   - 172.19.16.11

## Add other registry,example China registry mirror.
# docker_registry_mirrors:
#   - https://registry.docker-cn.com
#   - https://mirror.aliyuncs.com

## If non-empty will override default system MountFlags value.
## This option takes a mount propagation flag: shared, slave
## or private, which control whether mounts in the file system
## namespace set up for docker will receive or propagate mounts
## and unmounts. Leave empty for system default
# docker_mount_flags:

## A string of extra options to pass to the docker daemon.
## This string should be exactly as you wish it to appear.
