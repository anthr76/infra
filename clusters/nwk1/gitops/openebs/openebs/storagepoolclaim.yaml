        #For default sparse pool set the limit at 2Gi to safegaurd
        # cstor pool from consuming more memory and causing the node
        # to get into memory pressure condition. By default K8s will set the
        # Requests to the same value as Limits. For example, when Limit is
        # set to 2Gi, the pool could get stuck in pending schedule state,
        # if node doesn't have Requested (2Gi) memory.
        # Hence setting the Requests to a minimum (0.5Gi).
